                I live in Nashville, Tennessee and I am 23 years old. In my free time, I love to hang out with my family and friends, travel and code! I am an aspiring web developer. I'm currently enrolled in a Full-Stack Web Development bootcamp. My area of interests are front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, React, JavaScript.
                I am always eager to learn different things and expand my knowledge anyway I can! My portfolio showcases different projects I've made and collaborated on.
                Take a look around!
