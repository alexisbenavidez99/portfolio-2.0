            I am an aspiring web developer. I just obtained a certficate for Full-Stack Web Development. My area of interests are front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, React, JavaScript.
            I am always eager to learn different things and expand my knowledge anyway I can! My portfolio showcases different projects I've made and collaborated on.
